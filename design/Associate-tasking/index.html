<h2>Objective</h2>

<p>The prompt we received from The Home Depot is <b>Too Many Tasks</b>. The Home Depot is a home improvement retailer with thousands of indoor retail space across the US. The managers of the Home Depot noticed a problem that the associates in store conduct <b>trivial tasks in around 20 bays every day while complete projects</b>, and supervisors had to manage<b> 300 bays and assign projects weekly</b>. Also, supervisors<b> cannot always supervise the outcome of each task</b>, which leads to the concern that the quality of associates’ work remains hard to evaluate. </p>

<p><img alt="problem" title="problem" src="../../images/design/at-problem.png"></p>

<p>This problem is not only related to associates’ efficiency, but also has a huge influence on the <b>store management </b>and overall <b>customer experience</b>.</p>
<p><b>How might we improve the delegating &amp tasking experience for Associates &amp Supervisors?</b> </p>


<h2>Outcome</h2>
<p>We worked closely with The Home Depot for 17 weeks to tackle the problem. After the comprehensive user research, we clarified the problem space, empathized with our users, understood the stakeholders’ goals and used the data collected to create a system refining the workflow of both supervisors and associates. </p>
<p><img alt="outcome" title="outcome" src="../../images/design/at-solution.png"></p>
<p><img alt="outcome" title="outcome" src="../../images/design/at-pre.png"></p>



<h2 id="research">Research</h2>

<p>We used the first 2 months to understand the challenge.We collaborated and engaged in these research activities equally, as we considered it important to <b>keep the whole team on the same page</b>. With that said, I analysed 3 products in secondary research, conducted 
the initial observation and wrote a short report to socialize my findings. In interviews and contextual inquiries, 
I functioned as facilitator and moderator, interacting primarily with our interviewees.</p>
<p>After every round of data collection, we went through and discussed the notes we have as a team so we keep the whole team on the same page and decide the next step. </p>

<div class="project-gallery"><p><img alt="researchoverview" title="researchoverview" src="../../images/design/at-researchoverview.png"></p>
<label class="project-gallery image-caption">Research overview</label></div>

<p>In the very first stage, we <b>delved into the context </b>by conducting secondary research including literature review and competitive analysis, interviewing stakeholders and visiting the stores. We quickly <b>grasped the problem, identified target users, learned current situation, and retail terms</b> through these research activities.</p>

<div class="project-gallery"><p><img alt="research" src="../../images/design/at-research1.png"></p><label class="image-caption">Phase 1</label></div>

<p>In second phase we took a deep dive into the tasking experience of associates and the delegating experience of supervisors. We <b>empathized with end-users</b> by conducting observation sessions and contextual inquiries.</p>
<p>To fully understand the pain points of current tasking practice, we chose contextual inquiry as our primary method to research the associates, when associates were not available for interviews, we took a step back and observed them instead.</p>

<div class="project-gallery"><p><img alt="research" src="../../images/design/at-research2.png"></p><label class="image-caption">Phase 2</label></div>


<p>In the final stage, we engaged stakeholders in our research again to confirm the problems detected, decide the desirable outcome. By sharing our insights with stakeholders, we were able to <b>interpret the data in the correct direction</b> and <b>zoom out to the business level</b>.</p>

<div class="project-gallery"><p><img alt="research" src="../../images/design/at-research3.png"></p><label class="image-caption">Phase 3</label></div>

<h2 id="synthesis">Synthesize</h2>

<p>In terms of analyzing the data collected, as a team, we made agreement on what methods to choose and worked together to distill insights.</p>

<h3>Affinity diagramming</h3>
<p>We did affinity diagramming together to synthesize the data we collected from observation and contextual inquiry.</p>

<div class="project-gallery">
          <div class="project-grid-2"><a href="../../images/design/ataa.jpg" class="fluidbox"><img src="../../images/design/ataa.jpg" alt=""></a>

<!--<p>During the affinity mapping session, I visualized the <b>business goals and store layout</b> based on premiliary stakeholder interviews, expert interviews and photos from store visits. The business goal helped us to <b>prioratize information</b>, the store layout <b>contextualized the discussion and facilitated our meeting</b>.</p>!-->


          </div>


                                    <h3>Empathy map</h3>


<p>To better empathize with users, to <b>design with context</b>, we used empathy map to describe supervisors’ and associates’ current experience from cognitive perspective. This method helped us to always keep the contexts and users’ pain points in mind.</p>

</div>
                    <h3>Task analysis &amp; JTBD</h3>

          <p>As the problem is exclusively related to tasks, so we chose task-oriented methods to analyze the data. We used <b>task analysis</b> to illustrate the tasking process of associates and supervisors. To further synthesize the detailed attributes of those tasks, I created <b>JTBD model</b> to break down the major tasks of supervisors and associates into detailed steps and synthesize the emotions of supervisors and associates when they conduct tasks as well as the desired outcome of the tasks.</p>

<p>These synthesized data enables us to leverage our research findings. Finally, we <b>prioritized user requirements and correspondent design implications</b> to inform our iterative prototyping and testing.</p>

<h3>Brainstorming and idea evaluation</h3>

<div class="row"><div class="columns large-4" style="margin-top: 6%"><p>To keep the context in mind when we are generating solutions,I visualized the <b>store layout</b> based on photos from store visits. The store layout <b>contextualized the discussion</b> and facilitated our meeting</p></div><div class="columns large-8"><p><img alt="research" src="../../images/design/at-layout.png"></p></div>
</div>

<p>Based on the research findings, we did 2 rounds of 10 minutes brainstorming session where we wrote on stickys individually. We generated <b>more than 60 ideas</b>,. which we grouped into similar themes. </p>

<p><img src="../../images/design/atbs.jpg" alt="brainstorming"></p>

<p>Then with stakeholders’ goals and constraints in mind, we measured them by a<b> 2 by 2 matrix of creativity and feasibility</b> and found those highly possible ideas converged into 3 concepts.</p>

<p><img src="../../images/design/at-ideaeval.png" alt="evaluations"></p>

<p>We created paper prototypes for all 3 concepts <b>(I was responsible for concept 3 and dashboard)</b>and met with <b>a product manager</b> from The Home Depot to present our 3 concepts for a <b>3-hour feedback session</b> where we got <b>pros and cons for all the features</b> in our concepts. We decided to move on with concept 3 while merging AR planogram feature and voice report feature into it. Also we refined our dashboard concept.</p>

<h3>Finalize information architechture and wireframes</h3>
	<p>Then we quickly merged the sketches into one final paper concept to <b>present to 1 supervisor and 2 associates</b> at The Home Depot. Incorporating their feedback, we did a whiteboarding session where <b>I finalized the information architecture and user flow</b> for wireframes.</p> Then we collaborated to create the wireframes, I was responsible for the dashboard.

    <h3>Hifi prototype</h3>
     <p>We decided to use Material Design to create an intuitive product. We used a customized Material Design theme and followed Material guidelines to create the hi-fi prototype. <b>I was responsible for the supervisor’s dashboard</b>.</p>
   <img src="../../images/design/at-designguide.jpg" alt="guideline">
    <p>Then we collaborated to create an interactive prototype in InVision to evaluate and test. Link to the prototype can be found <a style="color: coral" href="https://invis.io/92PCGQGNEKU">here(Associates' app)</a> and <a style="color: coral" href="https://invis.io/FBPCHTVYHXS">here(Supervisors' dashboard)</a>.</p>

    <h2 id="evaluation">Evaluation &amp; iteration</h2>
             
             <p>I worked with the team to conduct heuristic evaluation and benchmarking usability testing where I functioned as facilitator, moderator and note taker. Then I worked with a teammate to summarize and prioritize the results we got. </p>

      		  		  <h3>Iteration 1 - AR list</h3>
		  <p>From the evaluation process, we found AR is the same worring as it is popular. To see why people are concerned about an innovative feature like it, I <b>analyzed the interaction flow</b> of the AR feature first. </p>
		  <p><img alt="arflow" title="arflow" src="../../images/design/at-arflow.png"></p>
		  <p>As shown above, people don't want to <b>risk starting with a whole new feature without further validation</b>. So  I decided to reorder the hierachy of AR POG and list POG, give The Home Depot <b>sufficient time to buffer and further test</b> the revamp</p>
    
    <!--<p>With the prototype, we conducted heuristic evaluation with 6 experts: UX designers and UX associates from The Home Depot UX team, and moderated user testing with 3 associates and 1 supervisor.</p>!-->

<!-- <h2>What’s next</h2>
   <p>Envisioning a ML + AR solution. What if 

Key touch points include the following.
</p>! -->
<h2 id="nextsteps"> Next steps </h2>
<p><b>Ideas didn’t make it: more feedback to keep improving the solution:</b> We envisioned a ML + AR solution that did not have a chance to be developed and tested. What if we met a data scientist from the Home Depot so that we could evaluate our more innovative ideas? What if we got to dig deeper to see the whole ecosystem of the Home Depot enterprise apps to further consider how our solution can integrate with the whole system? There is still a lot more to research and improve.</p>
<p><b>Setting metrics to measure success:</b> Although we presented the final design to the Home depot corporate and got very positive feedback, we did not know whether or when the design would be implemented which means we might not be able to measure the success. But I still want to consider both quantitative and qualitative metrics.</p>
<p><b>Honing visual details with design critiques:</b> Reflecting on the whole process, I realize that I can do better in crafting the final visual details. So I met with peers to conduct design critiques and hone the UI.</p>
<div class="project-gallery"> <p><img alt="UI honing" title="UI honing" src="../../images/design/at-wn.png"></p><label class="image-caption">Final interface after 3 rounds of peer critiques</label></div>


<h2 id="lessonlearned">Lessons learned</h2>
<p><b>Design is all about the mess of real world:</b> from higher levels like what structure to adopt and what information to show, to more detailed level like how big should a button be, everything in the final interface is about the context.</p>
<p><b>Everything exists for a reason:</b> In an interface, an element should always help or disappear. Never include or prioritize information that cannot help users tackle their problems, always ask why is the element important first.</p>
<p><b>Grab every chance to validate:</b> In our cooperation with The Home Depot, we found feedback from both stakeholders and users extremely helpful. Always ready to reach out to discuss, present, and iterate.</p>
