<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>Yunnan is a province feeding on tourism, so it is Yunnan's constant endeavor to improve tourists' experiences.  Last year, Yunnan tourism office recruited a team to create the mobile app Go Yunnan. However, Go Yunnan did not achieve good stats. Thus,  Yunnan tourism office commissioned Tencent to redesign Go-Yunnan. Over 4 months, I worked with my mentor and 1 other interaction designers, 2 visual designers with PMs and engineers from the client's side to ship the redesigned experience.</p>

<p> As the project proceed, we also finally pushed the scope to achieve more user/business value on a strategical level.</p>

  <h2>My contribution</h2>

<h2>Results</h2>
  <p><img alt="Go-Yunnan" title="Go-Yunnan" src="../../images/design/yunnan1-1-4.png"></p>

<h2>Prompt given</h2>

  <p><img alt="Go-Yunnan" title="Go-Yunnan" src="../../images/design/yunnan1-1-3.png"></p>


<h2>Understanding Go-Yunnan App</h2>

<p>We first spent time to understand what Go-Yunnan have to offer by talking with client, PMs. We synthesized our findings with SWOT analysis.</p>


<p><img alt="explore" title="explore" src="../../images/design/yunnan1-2.png"></p>


<div class="project-gallery"><p><img alt="definition" title="defination" src="../../images/design/yunnan1-3.png"></p>

<p>Looks like Go-Yunnan has some unique value to differentiate itself, then why users find it unusable and never like it?</p>

<h2>Identify problems from users and data</h2>
<p>We sent out a survey to internal users to collect on their feelings and got 85 responses. We arranged a 8 people focus group to dig deeper into the problems. I also asked developers for event tracking data of Go-Yunnan app for one month hoping to find the points users bounce out.</p>

<p><img alt="stakeholder" title="stakeholder" src="../../images/design/yunnan1-4.png"></p>
<h2>Understanding tourists with researchers </h2>
<p>I found researchers on my team have done a project investigating tourists, so I asked my mentor to set up a workshop with a researcher to leverage existing research insights. From the researcher, we learned about common pain points across 6 personas and also a common mental model.</p>

<p><img alt="stakeholder" title="stakeholder" src="../../images/design/yunnan1-6.png"></p>

<h2>Exploring information architecture </h2>
<p>I printed out all the key interfaces in Go-Yunnan App and invited designers and PMs to group them into common themes together
</p>

<p>We regrouped the sections and revamped the original information architecture. From this starting point, we moved forward to define the new IA for Go-Yunnan.</p>

<div class="project-gallery"><p><img alt="research" src="../../images/design/yunnan1-5.png"></p></div>

<p>After several rounds of Feedback sessions with clients, we achieved an agreement on the new structure which is a combination of hierarchy navigation and flat navigation. And we went on to design top-level interfaces. Due to project deadlines, we focused on the home screen redesign for this iteration.</p>

     </div>

<div class="project-gallery"><p><img alt="research" src="../../images/design/yunnan1-8.png"></p></div>

<h2>Home screen redesign</h2>

<p>Every Online Tourism Agent platform has a home screen, so I did a competitive analysis to see how other products approach their home screen. I mapped these home screens to a 2x2 matrix and discussed with the team to decide the goal we want to aim at.</p>

<p>Also we still have the AIPL model in mind, can we also apply it to the home screen?
My mentor and I worked on and finalized home screen design decisions after several whiteboarding sessions.
</p>
<div class="project-gallery"><p><img alt="research" src="../../images/design/yunnan1-9.png"></p></div>


<p>Proposing the decisions we made to our manager and clients was much easier than I imagined. Our clients make several further requests but agreed with the direction we were heading. So we created hifi prototype and started polishing the experience on this base.</p>

<div class="project-gallery"><p><img alt="research" src="../../images/design/yunnan1-11.png"></p></div>
<!-- <h2>Push it further</h2>

<p>After we shipped this iteration and gained positive feedback, I still kept thinking about the personas researchers showed us in the workshop. How might we improve the experience for such a diverse group? Can we push the current experience further for different groups?</p>

<div class="project-gallery"><p><img alt="research" src="../../images/design/yunnan1-12.png"></p></div>


<p> I talked with my mentor and the idea of a onboarding + recommendation system popped up. I created the prototypes and proposal to discuss with clients about the initiative.</p>

<div class="project-gallery"><p><img alt="research" src="../../images/design/yunnan1-13.png"></p></div>
 -->

<h2>Push it further</h2>

<p>Also, when I asked for log analysis from developers to showcase our impact, I found that although overall stats improved, CTR through each module is still relatively low compared to the offline salespoint. I recalled the journey map my mentor made in early phases and found that physical touchpoints also have a huge weight in this project. And there are holes in the current holistic experience.</p>

<div class="project-gallery"><p><img alt="service" src="../../images/design/yunnan1-14.png"></p></p><label class="image-caption">Service blueprint</label></div>


<p>I initiated another talk with my mentor about a strategical service design plan that take a holistic approach to the tourism service in Yunnan and found, my mentor was actually thinking about the same.</p>

<p>We worked together on a high-level strategical plan and proposed it to our manager, then to our client.</p>

<div class="project-gallery"><p><img alt="strategy" src="../../images/design/yunnan1-15.png"></p><label class="image-caption">High level product strategies</label></div>



<p>The implementation of the strategy is still up in the air, but they gave the service design on this project a kickoff. I believe our proposal will throw a stone in the pool and help our clients to rethink the experience from a holistic view, which will finally benefit the tourist group.
</p>

<h2>Learning outcomes &amp Reflection</h2>
<h3>Design? Strategy? Consultancy?</h3>
<p>Where does the value of design lie in today's industry and society when everyone is talking about user-centered? I realize the best way to ship a design switched from learning domain knowledge and doing designs ourselves to evangelizing design thinking and methods to domain experts and co-create designs with them.</p>

<h3>Lines between roles?</h3>
<p>I expected there to be clear division of responsibilities different roles was confused by the blurry line between PMs, researchers and designers. My mentor's idea inspired me a lot - Do whatever you are not banned to do, which encourage me to think thoroughly about the product at every stage and not solely focus on my part. </p>

<h3>Bigger picture</h3>
<p>I limited my vision on individual features and hoped to ship great user flows and interfaces. As the project proceeded, I realized that always having the business value and strategy in mind is key to creating a implementable product with greatest possible user value.</p>
