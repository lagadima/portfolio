<h1>Google design exercise</h1>

<h4>A 7-day design sprint</h4>

<p><img alt="google" title="google" src="../../images/design/google.png"></p>
<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p><img alt="timeline" title="timeline" src="../../images/design/g-timeline.png"></p>

<h2>Kicking off !</h2>

<p>I decided to kick off the project by <b>exploring the topic to identify what I know and what I don’t</b>. I conducted <b>2 unstructured interviews</b> with two of my contacts where I let them tell their <b>stories of browsing/ searching for/ proposing a student organization</b>. In the whole process, I kept asking them questions to make sure I understand everything.</p>

<p>From these two exploratory interviews, I identified <b>2 voids in my knowledge</b>. the first bundle is from the organization's side and these second bundle of questions is from the new students' side.</p>
<p>So I moved on to <b>craft a research plan</b> to look for answers to these questions before I think about the solution. I noticed <b>2 entities in the prompt: orientation team and new students</b>. To consider this experience from a holistic and high-level view, I planned to interview both groups.
</p>
<p><img alt="explore" title="explore" src="../../images/design/g-explore.png"></p>

<h2>Research</h2>
<h3>Understanding the domain</h3>

<p>Following my plan, I firstly rummaged the web. Having scanned through the definition, history, catergory… about student organizations, I <b>summarized the most important and relevant</b> information into a mind map.</p>

<div class="project-gallery"><p><img alt="definition" title="defination" src="../../images/design/g-studentorgdef.png"></p>

<p>After diving into this domain, I <b>scheduled an interview with a student organization coordinator</b> at center for student engagement at Georgia Tech to better understand details. I collected a lot of information which I summarized here with <b>stakeholder relationship map</b>, in which I identified my <b>key user groups as new students, current student organization leaders</b> and <b>main stakeholder as school office for student engagement</b>.</p>
<p><img alt="stakeholder" title="stakeholder" src="../../images/design/g-stakeholder.png"></p></div>

<p>Specifically, at Georgia tech, <b>offices for orientation and organization management are separated</b> ( Center for Student Engagement and New Student &amp; Transition Program), but as stated in this prompt, orientation team is not only responsible for organizing orientation events to help students browse/search for organizations (orientation), but also responsible for supporting students in proposing new organizations (management). In this case, I decided to <b>merge the two offices and consider the main stakeholder as a school office responsible for orientation and organization management</b>.</p>

<p>Also, I found some <b>surprising facts</b> and they gave me some important takeaways.</p>

<div class="project-gallery"><p><img alt="research" src="../../images/design/g-numbers.png"></p></div>

<h3>Understanding the users</h3>


<p>As identified in the stakeholder relationship map above, and stated in the prompt, I decided to know more about my key user groups: <b>new students joining a student org + student org leaders (turned from new students)</b>. To empathize with these users, I looked at <b>online forums </b>and conducted <b>semi-structured interviews</b>.</p>

<p>I first took a look at Reddit of Georgia tech and UC Davis to find some common pain points. And the results are pretty interesting.</p>

<div class="project-gallery"><p><img alt="reddit mining" src="../../images/design/g-reddit.png"></p><label class="image-caption">Insights from Reddit</label></div>

<p>With the background knowledge and a rough understanding of the problem space from online forum, I <b>created the interview protocol</b> and <b>conducted semi-structured interviews</b> with my key user groups. Interviews concluded the research phase of this design sprint, I moved on to synthesize all the data collected.</p>

<div class="project-gallery"><p><img alt="interview" src="../../images/design/g-interview.png"></p><label class="image-caption">Overview of my interviewees</label></div>


<h2>Synthesis</h2>
<h3>Affinity mapping</h3>
	<p>Right after I finished all the interviews, I used affinity mapping to summarize, personas and journey maps to analyze and empathize.  </p>

	<div class="large-6 columns" style="margin-top: 10%; padding-left: 0"><p>To synthesize the data collected from interviews, I wrote down all the problems and opportunities on stickys and did a <b>4-hour solo affinity diagraming session</b> in my room. </p>
	<p>This session helped me to sort out the whole problem, users’ problems, after which the whole process became crystal clear. I then created <b>personas</b> and <b>journey maps</b> to <b>sum up</b>, <b>analyze</b> and <b>keep myself empathized with users</b>. </p>
	</div>
			<div class="large-6 columns"><p><img alt="research" src="../../images/design/g-affinity.png"></p></div>
<h3>Persona</h3>
	<p>Going back to the key user groups and stakeholders identified in stakeholder relationship map, I realized that features that allow current org leaders to market themselves and get in touch with new students is <b>another end of the experience</b>. Also, as the main stakeholder, school offices are responsible for manage and bridging the 2 key user groups, which means <b>their needs should also be considered in this experience</b>. So I created <b>2 groups of personas</b>, <b>one group is primary users: new students</b>, and the other group one is <b>the other end of users</b>.</p>
		
	<p>For primary users, I summarized their <b>actions, priorities, frustrations and needs</b> from my research and found two distinctive personas emerge. So, I further <b>subdivided them into 2 personas</b>. </p>
			
<div class="project-gallery"><p><img alt="persona" src="../../images/design/g-persona.png"></p><label class="image-caption">Primary users</label></div>

<p>For users from the other end, I synthesized their according attributes and <b>keep their needs in mind too</b>.</p>
<div class="project-gallery"><p><img alt="persona" src="../../images/design/g-personaotherend.png"></p><label class="image-caption">The other end of users</label></div>
<h3>Journey map</h3>
         <p>I summarized and visualized the current browsing/searching/proposing experience of <b>primary users</b> using a <b>journey map</b>. Due to time constraints, I didn’t analyze the experience of the other end of users (org leaders and school office). I included <b>two personas in the same map</b> as their share similar actions on the same timeline. Also, I included their proposing journeys as potential org leaders, as <b>the decision to propose is closely related to the browsing/searching experience</b>. I used several colors and format to map different information and successfully summarized/embedded all the important attributes in this single map. Building this journey helped me to <b>understand the scope of the problem</b> and<b> sort out pain points of my primary users</b>.</p>
          </div>

      <div class="large-10 medium-12 large-offset-1 columns">
      <h3>Design goals</h3>
      <p>With pain points identified and the whole journey of the experience clarified, I moved on to <b>prioritize the pain points</b> and translate them into design goals. Due to time constraints, I used the data summarized in <b>personas to quickly check if the goals align with needs of the other end of users</b> (org leaders and school office). Unsurprisingly, I found the other end of users' needs were mainly about solving primary users' pain points, so I moved on with my design goals.</p>
<div class="project-gallery"><p><img alt="whiteboard" src="../../images/design/g-designgoal.png"></p><label class="image-caption">Goals distilled from pain points</label></div>      
<h2>Ideation</h2>
<h3>(I love) Whiteboarding!</h3>
<p>Throughout my synthesis process, I  was <b>scribbling down thoughts coming to my mind</b>. I was so happy and excited to find some of them are very feasible and creative!</p>

<div class="project-gallery"><p><img alt="whiteboard" src="../../images/design/g-whiteboard.png"></p><label class="image-caption">Happy whiteboard doodling</label></div>

<h3>Find a friend metaphor</h3>
		  <p>One of my favorite ideas on my whiteboard is <b>Find a friend metaphor</b>.</p> 

<p>As I wrote down quotes on post-its, created the journey map and stuff, I started to have this feeling that searching for an org is somehow similar to looking for new friends: people’s faces and names don’t matter that much, everyone’s past experience matters but is kind of hidden until you interact with them more (online and/or offline ), sometimes you meet your best friend by chance… So I was imagining, what if I <b>compare this experience of finding the right org to finding the right friend</b>?</p>

<p> In this case, student <b>Orgs will be socially active people</b> waiting for new friendships and <b>the design concept will be a social media platform</b>. Also, social elements are intrinsically embedded in the process of finding a new Org as inputs from friends are crucial in terms of deciding which events to go. 
</p>
<div class="project-gallery"><p><img alt="metaphor" src="../../images/design/g-metaphor.png"></p></div>

<p>Going back to my design goals, I found one key pain point remained less touched: <b>How can the experience leverage the real-world browsing experience?</b>  Specifically, how can this experience give new students more chance to <b>gain “real” interaction quickly with large amount of orgs</b> when they browse? How can I help them when they <b>miss the orientation/club fair/ first meetings</b> or their interested orgs can't make it to the orientation? </p>

<div class="project-gallery"><p><img alt="metaphor" src="../../images/design/g-metaphorrefine.png"></p></div>

<h3>Main concept and key features</h3>

<div class="large-4 columns" style="margin-top: 2%; padding-left: 0"><p>When I’m deciding key features, I encountered another questions - how to prioritize these features in my concept? I go back to personas and journey map <b>looking for evidence</b>.</p>
	<p>As identified, <b>events and videos</b> are obviously key to the browsing process while <b>interaction with friends</b> also important.</p></div>
			<div class="large-8 columns"><p><img alt="feature" src="../../images/design/g-keyfeature.png"></p></div>





<p>Okay! With the priority of key features laid out, this concept finally looks good to go! I moved on with this metaphor and developed my concept based on it.</p>


<div class="project-gallery"><p><img alt="final concept" src="../../images/design/g-finalconcept.png"></p><label class="image-caption">Final concept and key features</label></div>

<h3>Wait, did I go too far? let’s recap the prompt</h3>

<p>The concept seemed wild, so I decided to go back to the prompt and my research to <b>make sure I was still on the right track</b>. First, I needed to <b>recap the context and target users</b>. </p>

<p>The prompt is “an experience for new students to browse, search, and propose new student organizations” commissioned by an orientation team. As my research covered experiences of <b>college students from 4 different US schools</b>, plus I did find <b>a similar pattern in their experiences</b>, I was able to narrow down my target users to <b>new college students</b> and clarify the context to be<b> universities and colleges across the US</b> .</p>

<h3>Choose a platform</h3>

<p>There was one more thing to do before moving on to design - I needed to choose a platform and a native system to design for. So, <b>which platform?</b>  As shown in my journey map,  there is <b>a mixture of online and offline interactions</b> between new students and student organizations, which means <b>this digital experience should be deeply embedded in users’ daily life</b>. Also, students’ browsing/searching/proposing process usually <b>lasts from before orientation throughout the semester</b> (even after active recruiting ends), which indicates a <b>high using frequency of this design</b>. Thus, <b>I chose to design a mobile APP</b>.</p>

 <h3>Android or iOS?</h3>

<p>So, mobile APP, but <b>Android or iOS for now</b>? I researched online and found Android and iOS systems have <b>a rather even share</b> of the US college students market. Also, I looked into some social media app and found their iOS and Android <b>UI not significantly different</b>. Due to time constraints, I considered it <b>more important to build out my whole concept and key functions</b> in the wireframe instead of polishing every detail for these two systems. So I decided to <b>go with iOS </b>which I’m more familiar with for now.</p>

<h3>Wait wait wait, one last thing… what’s the picture of the whole system</h3>

<p>Although I decided to mainly focus on primary users, but I still considered it important to get a whole picture and think about this design <b>from both ends of users’ side</b>, so I went back to personas and the journey map, and zoomed out to a higher level to look at this experience. Taking a step back, I found there may be at least two portals in the whole system, due to time constraints, I only considered the design for <b>primary users</b>.</p>

<div class="project-gallery"><p><img alt="whole system" src="../../images/design/g-wholesystem.png"></p><label class="image-caption">The whole system</label></div>

<h2>Design</h2>

<h3>Sketch for a concept feedback session</h3>
<div>
<div class="large-6 columns" style="margin-top: 2%; padding-left: 0"><p>I quickly sketched out some <b>screens of key features</b> on paper and got back to <b>one user</b> who had both experience browsing/searching and proposing new student orgs (Hiroo) to conduct a <b>feedback session</b>. I also recruited <b>an expert</b> (an HCI student with a CS background) to conduct another feedback session on the <b>technical feasibility</b> of my ideas.</p>
	</div>
			<div class="large-6 columns"><p><img alt="research" src="../../images/design/g-ppp.png"></p></div>
		  </div>
		  
<p>I collected a lot of pros and cons for my concept!</p>
<div class="project-gallery"><p><img alt="feedback session" src="../../images/design/g-feedback.png"></p><label class="image-caption">Important pros and cons from the feedback session</label></div>

<p>Incorporating the feedback from the user and the expert, I drew out the <b>information architecture</b> of my final concept to guide my wireframing. </p>
<div class="project-gallery"><p><img alt="information architecture" src="../../images/design/g-ia.png"></p><label class="image-caption">Information architecture</label></div>

<h3>Finally, time to wireframe</h3>
	
<p>As social media related features already have a lot of intuitive UI patterns out on the market, I decided <b>not to invent the new wheel</b> but take a look at existing patterns and base my design on them. So I was doing <b>competitive analysis</b> throughout my design process.</p>

<h3>Features for browsing</h3>

<p>First thing: landing screen! I did a competitive analysis on the posts/timeline/feeds patterns on <b>Facebook, Twitter, and Reddit</b>. I decided to go with <b>Facebook’s pattern</b> as it’s more suitable when <b>different kinds of posts are mixed together</b>, and it makes use of all the space.
</p>
   <p><img src="../../images/design/g-design1.png" alt="feed"></p>
<p>As mentioned before, <b>events and videos</b> are more important. So I decided to only polish these two types of feeds (including the detail page). Also, as users are browsing/searching for orgs, <b>profile pages</b> for these organizations are also extremely important to polish. </p>

<p>When it came to decide what <b>information and actions</b> to include for these three important pages, I went back to research again. Starting from the elements I used to priotize features, I translated them into desired info and actions, and then summarized them into these three types of pages.</p>
   <p><img src="../../images/design/g-design3.png" alt="feeddetail"></p>
   
   <p>Specifically, for the video detail page, I looked into short video and live streaming apps including <b>Twitch, Bilibili, Tik Tok and Facebook video</b>. Reminding myself that <b>the goal of presenting videos here is to social and interact</b>, I decided to go with Bilibili’s <b>real-time bullet comment</b> feature (for more interaction) and Tik Tok’s <b>portrait full-screen UI</b> (most popular pattern for videos related to real life/live)</p>
   <p><img src="../../images/design/g-design4.png" alt="feeddetail"></p>
   
   <p>Finally, there is one more important stage in the browsing experience - onboarding. <b>How would users find some initial orgs to start exploring?</b></p>
   
   <p>Again, I did a <b>competitive analysis</b> of the onboarding/ finding people to follow experience with <b>Instagram, Pinterest, Spotify, and Twitter</b>. I find Spotify’s and Twitter’s style more suitable as they incorporated <b>categories to filter</b> and <b>profiles to follow</b>. So I drew them down to further compare. </p>
   
   <p><img src="../../images/design/g-design2.png" alt="onboarding"></p>
   
   <p>To decide, I went back to journey map and personas to <b>empathize with user’s onboarding experience</b>. Interest-driven users will directly search for what they want so there is no difference. But for random exploring users, they don’t have much knowledge of orgs and what these orgs do yet at this stage, so it’s more efficient for them to <b>filter by category first</b> instead of directly follow some seemingly interesting orgs.</p>
   
<h3>Features for searching</h3>

   <p>UI for search function is rather standard so I<b> made UI decisions quickly</b>. But when designing scan function, I was faced with a dilemma: <b>Where should the scan icon be?</b> As it’s a rather important feature, I originally decided to put in on the bottom tab bar. But after reviewing other scan UI patterns on market, I found scan icon itself never appears there, which makes me reconsider my decision.</p>   
 
   <div class="large-6 columns" style="margin-top: 2%; padding-left: 0"><p>So, what does scan functionality do? The same as search. This indicates that it should be of the <b>same hierarchy/ position as the search field.</b> Also, I went back to journey map and found <b>the most frequent use case</b> of the scan feature would be on the move (users are not on their phone), which means it’s already sufficient to place it beside search field on feed (landing screen).</p>
	</div>
			<div class="large-6 columns"><p><img src="../../images/design/g-design5.png" alt="scan"></p></div>
   <h3>And finally features for proposing</h3>
   
   <p>Emmm, seems like I haven’t thought about the details about proposing process in this concept. I quickly <b>got back to design goals</b> and wrote down users’ tasks to see how can existing features help. I was so happy when I found the design goal for proposing also fit into features that can be <b>integrated into this main concept</b>. Based on the features mapped out, I created wireframes for proposing.</p>
   
   <p><img src="../../images/design/g-design6.png" alt="proposing"></p>
   
   <h2>The whole annotated wireframe flow</h2>
 
	</div>
 </div>

   <img style="margin-bottom: 5%; width: 100%" src="../../images/design/g-wireframe.png">
   <div class="row">
      <div class="large-10 medium-12 large-offset-1 columns">
<h2>Cognitive walkthrough and iterations</h2>
	<p>To see if my design went against any heuristics or common practices, I met with a second year HCI student to conduct a <b>cognitive walkthrough</b> session where some <b>potential usability issues</b> were identified.</p> 
	<p><ul><li>Proposing process should be clearer to follow, try onboard users with pop-up</li>
	<li>Proposing instruction is not intuitive enough and may cause confusion, try replace event list here with to-do list or include a progress tracking function</li>
	<li>Also consider how can school manage these new orgs which are in proposing process, and how to confirm it finishes registration process.</li>
	<li>Make sure categories and tags cover all orgs, users would consider scrolling to bottom mean they can see everything. <b>Don't make users have to use search function</b> to look for what they want.</li>
	<li>Be careful about retrieving information from other platforms, consider both technical feasibility and security/ privacy concern</li>
	<li>Why add and share button so salient in event page? Are these actions that important?s</li>
	<li>Consider more <b>from the other end of users</b>, like if an event needs reservation, how to incorporate that? Also consider more about the <b>stakeholder</b>, how can your design <b>help with orientation events</b>?
</li>
	</ul></p>
	<p>Due to time constraints, I can’t conduct usability testing or iterate on all the issues. So, I decided to <b>prioritize more important issues to fix</b>. According to these feedback, I considered the proposing and onboarding flow are the most problematic because the issues may <b>cause users to fail</b>. So, I iterated these two flows with following changes</p>

	    <div class="large-6 columns" style="margin-top: 2%; padding-left: 0"><p><b>Iteration 1</b>: Tags in popular categories to in all categories</p><p>One more questions here is how to decide the order of the categories to enhance the filter feature and minimize the <b>bad experience of long scroll</b> - I need more research to inform me of the contexts.</p>
	</div>
			<div class="large-6 columns"><p><img src="../../images/design/g-i1.png" alt="iteration"></p></div>
       <p><b>Iteration 2</b>: onboarding added for proposing process</p><p></p>

       <p><img src="../../images/design/g-i2.png" alt="onboarding"></p>
    
    <h3>Hifi prototype</h3>
     <p>When deciding the visual style, once again I went back to the defined context and target user group. As I’m designing for new students, so the visual style should be modern, vibrant and minimalist. As I’m designing for millions of student orgs in universities and colleges across the US, the same design guidelines should be applicable to different schools’/orgs’ branding/visual language.</p>
       <p><img src="../../images/design/g-hifi.png" alt="hifi"></p>
       <h2>What’s next (if given more time)</h2>
       <h3>Enhancing the experience from real-world</h3>
       <p>Given that the prompt is assigned by the orientation team, I should explore more on the <b>touch points of my design with orientation events specifically</b>. I have been hitting the “real” interaction a lot from the digital design side, but can I approach the experience more from the <b>service design</b> side?</p>
       <h3>Validation from the other end of users</h3>
       <p>I designed this experience mostly based on the needs of new students. But the other end of users are the ones who will generate and post the feeds, interact with new students, and keep using this app to both browse and manage. If given more time, I want to <b>research the other end of users</b> to further polish the design. </p>
       <h3>Consider and validate more edge cases with usability testings</h3>
       <p>How long will the description/caption for a post be? What format of videos (landscape/ portrait) would be easier and more appealing to new students? To what extent can the integration with outside apps be? These are some questions need further research and testing.</p>
       
       <h2>Final thoughts</h2>
       
       <p>Hooray! Thank you for making it here! (Hope it’s interesting to read as the process was really  interesting itself!)</p>
       
       <p>It’s been one year since the last time I did a design sprint, and I almost forgot how exciting sprints are. This design exercise brought me back to my honeymoon with design. During the whole 7 days, I kept feeling the way a girl sitting next to her first love, shy, ecstatic, eager to embrace the future commitment.</p>
       
       <p>The process is difficult: although I have always been interested in social media, this is my first time actually designing a social media platform. I picked up so much knowledge along the way and grew a lot in such a short period. This design exercise also let me know my expertise better - understanding, fast learning and creative thinking. I found myself really good at understanding people and complicated contexts as I am always open to try new ways of living.</p>
